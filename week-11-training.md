# Week 11 Training

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

### Monday
1. Work on your project 3 idea. Think about what to build as well as the tools you'd like to build with.  It should be a full-stack application. 

1. Skim documentation or lessons for Passport (for MEN authentication) or Satellizer (for MEAN authentication), both of which are linked as [References in the Express Auth lesson](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/express-simple-auth#resources). If you're interested in using one of these in your project, spend a little more time with the documentation.

1. Skim the Rails Guide on [Using Rails for API-only Applications](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html).  How would you use Angular with a Rails API back end?  If you're interested in doing this for your project 3, dive deeper.  You may find it helpful to reference a previous cohort's [Rails 4 API lab](tps://github.com/sf-wdi-31/rails-api-lab) and the corresponding [Rails 4 API lesson](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/rails-api-lesson), but keep in mind that built-in API-only configuration is a brand new feature in Rails 5. 

### Tuesday

1. Complete the [peer feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdD99F2w6ul4TupNq-lNwjoq82oYe6hGeKgERzJhGcsKnqtHQ/viewform)!

1. Work through the [Project 3](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/project-03) [planning deliverables](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/project-03#planning--deliverables) so that you'll be ready to meet for approval tomorrow.

# Week 9 Training

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

### Monday

Continue Vagabond!

### Tuesday

Continue Vagabond!  There's a feature freeze in effect, so focus on documentation, presentation, user experience tweaks, and/or polishing your code. 

### Wednesday

1. Fill out the [vagabond peer feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/i907oohHpJvnl3ga2).

1. Prepare your [project 2 pitch](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/project-2/blob/master/lightning-pitch.md) - you can refer to the [project 2 specs](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/project-2).

1. Prepare your [lightning talk](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/ruby-lightning-talks).


<!-- 
1. Finish challenge 2 of the [JavaScript in Rails](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/js-in-rails) exercise. Yee-haw!

2. Finish the [asset pipeline poem](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/rails-asset-pipeline-poem).  When you're finished, update the readme on the master branch of your asset pipeline poem fork. Add an intro section that has 3-5 sentences of reflection on your experience with the asset pipeline (e.g., what did you learn? how will you use these tools again later?).  Then, also link this repo on the "My Work" section of your personal website. 

3. Complete part 2 of the [public library app](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/public-library-app).  Also choose at least one **bonus** to implement from:
  - [part 1](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/public-library-app/blob/master/1_users_and_auth.md#bonus) (authorization & validation)
  - [middle of part 2](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/public-library-app/blob/master/2_library_users.md#cruding-libraries) (CRUD libraries), or  
  - [end of part 2](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/public-library-app/blob/master/2_library_users.md#bonuses) (add books - larger scope)
  
  When you're finished, update your project repo so the readme starts with a 3-5 sentence reflection on doing this project.  Then, link your repo on the "My Work" section of your personal website. 
  
4. Review the learning objectives from this week. Identify an at least one question you have, one area where you'd like more practice, and one area where you're feeling confident.  Write all of these down to bring with you tomorrow. 

With extra time, you could:
 - Use heroku's docs (linked in [auth power hour resources](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/pwr-hr-auth#resources)) to deploy your library app to heroku. If you do get deployed, update your GitHub readme with a link to the live app! 
 - try the ["Take it Further" exercises from the asset pipeline poem](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/rails-asset-pipeline/blob/master/exercises.md)
 - try challenge 3 of the [JavaScript in Rails](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/js-in-rails) exercise

# Week 8 Training

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

### Monday

Continue work on the [pet app](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/rails-pet-lab). After at least an hour working on part 1 move on to part 2. Put at least an hour into part 2 before giving a careful look to the solutions. If time permits, get started on your chosen challenge for part 3.

### Tuesday

1. Complete part 1 of the [library app training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/public-library-app/blob/master/1_users_and_auth.md), including the practice (making another app). Make sure to read through the [solution code](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/public-library-app/tree/solution_1_users_and_auth/lib_app) and study any parts that gave you difficulty. If you have time, work on the bonuses.

2. In preparation for tomorrow afternoon, read the [asset pipeline rails guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html), sections 1 and 2.

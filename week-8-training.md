# Week 8 Training

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

### Monday

Continue work on the [pet app](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/rails-pet-lab). After at least an hour working on part 1 move on to part 2. Put at least an hour into part 2 before giving a careful look to the solutions. If time permits, get started on your chosen challenge for part 3.

### Tuesday

1. Complete part 1 of the [library app training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/public-library-app/blob/master/1_users_and_auth.md), including the practice (making another app). Make sure to read through the [solution code](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/public-library-app/tree/solution_1_users_and_auth/lib_app) and study any parts that gave you difficulty. If you have time, work on the bonuses.

2. In preparation for tomorrow afternoon, read the [asset pipeline rails guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html), sections 1 and 2.


### Wednesday

1. Finish the [asset pipeline poem](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/rails-asset-pipeline-poem) and the ["Take it Further" exercises from this afternoon](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/rails-asset-pipeline/blob/master/exercises.md).  When you're finished, update the readme on the master branch of your asset pipeline poem fork. Add an intro section that has 3-5 sentences of reflection on your experience with this project.  Then, also link this repo on the "My Work" section of your personal website. 

2. Complete part 2 of the [public library app](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/public-library-app).  Also choose at least one **bonus** to implement from:
  - [part 1](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/public-library-app/blob/master/1_users_and_auth.md#bonus) (authorization or validation)
  - [mid part 2](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/public-library-app/blob/master/2_library_users.md#cruding-libraries) (CRUD libraries), or  
  - [end of part 2](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/public-library-app/blob/master/2_library_users.md#bonuses) (add books - larger scope)
  
  When you're finished, update your project repo so the readme starts with a 3-5 sentence reflection on doing this project (what did you learn? how will you use these tools again later?).  Then, link your repo on the "My Work" section of your personal website. 
  
3. Follow heroku docs (linked in [auth power hour](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/pwr-hr-auth#resources)) to deploy your library app to heroku. Make sure you're starting with a version of you library app that's working locally.  Remember to communicate about any issues on Slack! Don't spend more than an hour debugging a deploy. 

3. Review the learning objectives from this week. Identify an at least one question you have, one area where you'd like more practice, and one area where you're feeling confident.  Write all of these down to bring with you tomorrow.
